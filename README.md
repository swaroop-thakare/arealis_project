## Fashion Retail Dashboard Readme


###  GOAL:

Show how the data (after ingestion and cleaning) should be presented to end-users in the form of a dashboard that helps them make smart decisions in fashion retail.

---

###  Problem Area:

**Blind Retail Decisions Due to No Analytics Access**
Fashion retail managers or business owners are making important business decisions without seeing any data — or without understanding what the data is telling them. They are effectively "flying blind."

---

###  TASK 1: Pick 6 Core Visualizations Fashion Businesses Absolutely Need

**Objective:**
Identify and define the six most essential visualizations that will empower fashion retailers to make informed, data-driven decisions and overcome the challenge of blind decision-making due to lack of analytics access.

####  1.  Daily & Weekly Sales Trend – Line Chart

 **Purpose:** Monitor and compare daily/weekly revenue performance to identify seasonality, dip patterns, and campaign impact.

 **Business Value:**

* Reveal high-performing days (e.g., weekend spikes)
* Optimize ad timing and staff rosters
* Predict sales curves over time (with AI forecasting layer)

 **Example Output:**
A line chart with the X-axis as calendar days (e.g., June 1 to June 30) and the Y-axis showing revenue (₹). Sample data:

* June 01 (Mon): ₹12,500
* June 02 (Tue): ₹15,800
* June 03 (Wed): ₹9,300
* June 07 (Sun): ₹21,500  ⟶ Highest peak

 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  store_id,
  DATE(sale_datetime) AS sale_date,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY store_id, sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

---

####  2.  Product Category/Style Performance – Grouped Bar Chart

 **Purpose:** Analyze which product categories, styles, and trends are selling best across the store or chain — with the ability to segment by brand and trend.

 **Business Value:**

* Focus promotions on high-performing styles and trends
* Guide inventory decisions per brand-trend combinations
* Identify category leaders within seasonal or generational fashion trends

 **Example Output:**
Grouped bar chart where each group represents a product category (e.g., Denim, Ethnic, Athleisure). Each bar in a group is a brand:

* Denim: Levi’s (500), Zara (450), H\&M (300)
* Ethnic: BIBA (600), FabIndia (420), Global Desi (390)

 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  category, 
  SUM(units_sold) AS total_units
FROM sales
GROUP BY brand, trend, category;
```

---

####  3.  Inventory Aging – Heatmap or Bar Chart

 **Purpose:** Track how long inventory items remain unsold.

**Business Value:**

* Avoid dead stock
* Optimize markdown planning
* Refresh slow-moving styles based on trend & brand

 **Example Output:**
A heatmap showing brands as rows and time brackets as columns:

* Zara:

  * 0–30 days: 150 units
  * 31–60 days: 90 units
  * 61+ days: 60 units
* H\&M:

  * 0–30 days: 200 units
  * 31–60 days: 40 units
  * 61+ days: 300 units  ⟶ highlighted in red (slow moving)

 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  CASE 
    WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), added_date) <= 30 THEN '0–30 days'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), added_date) <= 60 THEN '31–60 days'
    ELSE '61+ days'
  END AS age_bracket,
  COUNT(*) AS item_count
FROM inventory
GROUP BY brand, trend, age_bracket;
```

---

####  4.  Size Sell-Through Rate – Stacked Bar or Pie Chart

 **Purpose:** See which sizes sell fast and which are overstocked, filtered by trend and brand.

 **Business Value:**

* Adjust future purchase ratios
* Align stocking with customer demand by trend
* Reduce excess inventory on slow-moving sizes

**Example Output:**
Stacked bar chart per product:

* Product: Men’s Shirt (Brand: U.S. Polo, Trend: Formal)

  * XS: 90%
  * S: 80%
  * M: 95%
  * L: 60%
  * XL: 30%
    Colors indicate sell-through percentage; low-performing sizes marked in red.

**Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  size,
  SUM(units_received) AS total_received,
  SUM(units_sold) AS total_sold,
  (SUM(units_sold)/SUM(units_received))*100 AS sell_through
FROM inventory_stats
GROUP BY brand, trend, size;
```

---

####  5.  Return Reasons Breakdown – Pie or Bar Chart

**Purpose:** Understand why customers are returning items based on the associated brand/trend.

**Business Value:**

* Fix design/sizing/quality issues
* Minimize future returns through feedback
* Compare return patterns across trends

**Example Output:**
Pie chart with return reasons:

* Fit Issue – 42%
* Color Mismatch – 23%
* Fabric Quality – 18%
* Damaged – 10%
* Others – 7%
  Bar view also shows brand-wise breakdown of top return reasons.

 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  reason, 
  COUNT(*) AS return_count
FROM returns
GROUP BY brand, trend, reason;

```

6.  Foot Traffic & Hourly Sales Heatmap – Store-Level Grid
 Purpose: Understand which hours and days see the most customer visits or sales at each store.

Business Value:

Optimize store staffing and promotional timing

Detect peak and off-peak hours

Support store layout planning and event scheduling

Compare footfall vs. actual conversions

Example Output:
A heatmap grid where:

Rows = Days of the week (Mon to Sun)

Columns = Hours (e.g., 10 AM to 9 PM)

Cell Color = Sales or visitor count intensity

Example (for a Zara Store):

10 AM	11 AM	12 PM	1 PM	2 PM	...	8 PM
Monday	20	30	40	45	25	...	15
Tuesday	15	22	35	50	28	...	20
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...
Sunday	30	45	70	90	85	...	60

Color intensity increases with footfall/sales.
 Logic:

Input Table: sales or foot_traffic
Group by: DAYOFWEEK(sale_datetime), HOUR(sale_datetime)
Aggregate: SUM(amount) or COUNT(*) (for transactions)

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  DAYNAME(sale_datetime) AS sale_day,
  HOUR(sale_datetime) AS sale_hour,
  COUNT(*) AS transaction_count,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY sale_day, sale_hour
ORDER BY FIELD(sale_day, 'Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'), sale_hour;

Scalability:

Add filters for store_id, brand, or trend

Use foot_traffic sensor data if available for more precise visitor count

##  Challenges in Building Scalable, Modular Dashboards

### 1. **Handling Lots of Data**
- As your business grows, you’ll have more sales, inventory, and customer data.
- Too much data can make dashboards slow or hard to use.
- Example: If you start with 1 shop and grow to 10, your dashboard must handle 10 times more data.

### 2. **Bringing Data Together**
- Your data may come from different places: in-store sales, online sales, inventory systems, etc.
- It’s hard to combine all this data in one place and keep it updated.
- Example: Sales from your shop’s POS system and your website need to show up together on your dashboard.

### 3. **Making Dashboards Flexible**
- You might want to add new charts or remove old ones as your needs change.
- The dashboard should let you do this easily, without breaking other parts.
- Example: You want to add a new chart for “top-selling brands” next month.

### 4. **Keeping Dashboards Fast and Easy to Use**
- Dashboards should load quickly, even with lots of data.
- They should be simple to read and not overwhelm users with too much information.
- Example: If your dashboard takes a long time to load, users won’t use it.

### 5. **Ensuring Data is Accurate and Up-to-Date**
- If data isn’t correct or current, you might make bad decisions.
- Dashboards should update automatically and show the latest numbers.
- Example: You want to see today’s sales, not last week’s.

### 6. **Making Updates and Maintenance Easy**
- As your business or team grows, you’ll need to update the dashboard.
- It should be easy to add new data sources or features without starting from scratch.

## **Summary Table**

| Challenge                | Why It Matters                        | Example                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Lots of data             | Can slow down dashboard               | More shops = more sales data     |
| Different data sources   | Hard to combine and keep updated      | POS + online sales               |
| Flexibility              | Need to add/remove charts easily      | Add “top brand” chart anytime    |
| Speed & simplicity       | Users need quick, easy insights       | Fast loading, clear visuals      |
| Data accuracy            | Decisions depend on correct data      | See today’s sales, not old data  |
| Easy to update           | Business changes, dashboard should too| New features as you grow         |

**In short:**  
A good dashboard should be fast, flexible, easy to use, always up-to-date, and ready to grow with your business. Building one like this takes careful planning and the right tools.
