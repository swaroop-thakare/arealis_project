## Fashion Retail Dashboard Readme


### 🧠 GOAL:

Show how the data (after ingestion and cleaning) should be presented to end-users in the form of a dashboard that helps them make smart decisions in fashion retail.

---

### 🚨 Problem Area:

**Blind Retail Decisions Due to No Analytics Access**
Fashion retail managers or business owners are making important business decisions without seeing any data — or without understanding what the data is telling them. They are effectively "flying blind."

---

### ✅ TASK 1: Pick 6 Core Visualizations Fashion Businesses Absolutely Need

**Objective:**
Identify and define the six most essential visualizations that will empower fashion retailers to make informed, data-driven decisions and overcome the challenge of blind decision-making due to lack of analytics access.

#### 🔹 1. 📈 Daily & Weekly Sales Trend – Line Chart

🎯 **Purpose:** Monitor and compare daily/weekly revenue performance to identify seasonality, dip patterns, and campaign impact.

💼 **Business Value:**

* Reveal high-performing days (e.g., weekend spikes)
* Optimize ad timing and staff rosters
* Predict sales curves over time (with AI forecasting layer)

📊 **Example Output:**
A line chart with the X-axis as calendar days (e.g., June 1 to June 30) and the Y-axis showing revenue (₹). Sample data:

* June 01 (Mon): ₹12,500
* June 02 (Tue): ₹15,800
* June 03 (Wed): ₹9,300
* June 07 (Sun): ₹21,500  ⟶ Highest peak

🧠 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  store_id,
  DATE(sale_datetime) AS sale_date,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY store_id, sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

---

#### 🔹 2. 🧵 Product Category/Style Performance – Grouped Bar Chart

🎯 **Purpose:** Analyze which product categories, styles, and trends are selling best across the store or chain — with the ability to segment by brand and trend.

💼 **Business Value:**

* Focus promotions on high-performing styles and trends
* Guide inventory decisions per brand-trend combinations
* Identify category leaders within seasonal or generational fashion trends

📊 **Example Output:**
Grouped bar chart where each group represents a product category (e.g., Denim, Ethnic, Athleisure). Each bar in a group is a brand:

* Denim: Levi’s (500), Zara (450), H\&M (300)
* Ethnic: BIBA (600), FabIndia (420), Global Desi (390)

🧠 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  category, 
  SUM(units_sold) AS total_units
FROM sales
GROUP BY brand, trend, category;
```

---

#### 🔹 3. 📦 Inventory Aging – Heatmap or Bar Chart

🎯 **Purpose:** Track how long inventory items remain unsold.

💼 **Business Value:**

* Avoid dead stock
* Optimize markdown planning
* Refresh slow-moving styles based on trend & brand

📊 **Example Output:**
A heatmap showing brands as rows and time brackets as columns:

* Zara:

  * 0–30 days: 150 units
  * 31–60 days: 90 units
  * 61+ days: 60 units
* H\&M:

  * 0–30 days: 200 units
  * 31–60 days: 40 units
  * 61+ days: 300 units  ⟶ highlighted in red (slow moving)

🧠 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  CASE 
    WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), added_date) <= 30 THEN '0–30 days'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), added_date) <= 60 THEN '31–60 days'
    ELSE '61+ days'
  END AS age_bracket,
  COUNT(*) AS item_count
FROM inventory
GROUP BY brand, trend, age_bracket;
```

---

#### 🔹 4. 📏 Size Sell-Through Rate – Stacked Bar or Pie Chart

🎯 **Purpose:** See which sizes sell fast and which are overstocked, filtered by trend and brand.

💼 **Business Value:**

* Adjust future purchase ratios
* Align stocking with customer demand by trend
* Reduce excess inventory on slow-moving sizes

📊 **Example Output:**
Stacked bar chart per product:

* Product: Men’s Shirt (Brand: U.S. Polo, Trend: Formal)

  * XS: 90%
  * S: 80%
  * M: 95%
  * L: 60%
  * XL: 30%
    Colors indicate sell-through percentage; low-performing sizes marked in red.

🧠 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  size,
  SUM(units_received) AS total_received,
  SUM(units_sold) AS total_sold,
  (SUM(units_sold)/SUM(units_received))*100 AS sell_through
FROM inventory_stats
GROUP BY brand, trend, size;
```

---

#### 🔹 5. 🔄 Return Reasons Breakdown – Pie or Bar Chart

🎯 **Purpose:** Understand why customers are returning items based on the associated brand/trend.

💼 **Business Value:**

* Fix design/sizing/quality issues
* Minimize future returns through feedback
* Compare return patterns across trends

📊 **Example Output:**
Pie chart with return reasons:

* Fit Issue – 42%
* Color Mismatch – 23%
* Fabric Quality – 18%
* Damaged – 10%
* Others – 7%
  Bar view also shows brand-wise breakdown of top return reasons.

🧠 **Logic:**

```sql
SELECT 
  brand,
  trend,
  reason, 
  COUNT(*) AS return_count
FROM returns
GROUP BY brand, trend, reason;
```

##  Challenges in Building Scalable, Modular Dashboards

### 1. **Handling Lots of Data**
- As your business grows, you’ll have more sales, inventory, and customer data.
- Too much data can make dashboards slow or hard to use.
- Example: If you start with 1 shop and grow to 10, your dashboard must handle 10 times more data.

### 2. **Bringing Data Together**
- Your data may come from different places: in-store sales, online sales, inventory systems, etc.
- It’s hard to combine all this data in one place and keep it updated.
- Example: Sales from your shop’s POS system and your website need to show up together on your dashboard.

### 3. **Making Dashboards Flexible**
- You might want to add new charts or remove old ones as your needs change.
- The dashboard should let you do this easily, without breaking other parts.
- Example: You want to add a new chart for “top-selling brands” next month.

### 4. **Keeping Dashboards Fast and Easy to Use**
- Dashboards should load quickly, even with lots of data.
- They should be simple to read and not overwhelm users with too much information.
- Example: If your dashboard takes a long time to load, users won’t use it.

### 5. **Ensuring Data is Accurate and Up-to-Date**
- If data isn’t correct or current, you might make bad decisions.
- Dashboards should update automatically and show the latest numbers.
- Example: You want to see today’s sales, not last week’s.

### 6. **Making Updates and Maintenance Easy**
- As your business or team grows, you’ll need to update the dashboard.
- It should be easy to add new data sources or features without starting from scratch.

## **Summary Table**

| Challenge                | Why It Matters                        | Example                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Lots of data             | Can slow down dashboard               | More shops = more sales data     |
| Different data sources   | Hard to combine and keep updated      | POS + online sales               |
| Flexibility              | Need to add/remove charts easily      | Add “top brand” chart anytime    |
| Speed & simplicity       | Users need quick, easy insights       | Fast loading, clear visuals      |
| Data accuracy            | Decisions depend on correct data      | See today’s sales, not old data  |
| Easy to update           | Business changes, dashboard should too| New features as you grow         |

**In short:**  
A good dashboard should be fast, flexible, easy to use, always up-to-date, and ready to grow with your business. Building one like this takes careful planning and the right tools.
